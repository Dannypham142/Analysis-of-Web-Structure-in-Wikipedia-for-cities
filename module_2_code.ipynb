    "Write a Medium post on analyzing the structure of a Web-based network. Relevant networks or graphs include the Web graph (e.g., edges between domains or edges between articles in a single web site) or online social networks. In your analysis, define what it means for a node to be \"important\" and describe how you might find such a node in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your post should include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Describe a question you think can be answered using network data, what specific stakeholder is asking this question, and what decision(s) the answer to this question will inform.\n",
    "* Describe the data that could answer this question, what fields it contains, and why it is relevant to your question.\n",
    "* Explain how you collected some subset of this data (e.g., libraries like requests, BeautifulSoup, tweepy, praw, etc. or from data archive).\n",
    "* Define what entity is represented by a node/vertex in the graph, and what relationship between these nodes does an edge represent.\n",
    "* Define \"importance\" in your graph and identify a set of at least three important nodes.\n",
    "* Provide an answer to your question, explaining your analysis of the data you collected, and how it answers that question.\n",
    "* Include figures or tables summarizing your findings. \n",
    "* Describe how you cleaned up this data, common bugs you think others might encounter, and how you fixed them, etc.\n",
    "* Discuss the limitations of your analysis. Whatâ€™s missing? How might it be biased?\n",
    "* Include a link to one of your GitHub repositories that contains the code you have developed for this assignment."
